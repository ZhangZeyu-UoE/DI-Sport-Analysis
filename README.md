# DI-Sport-Analysis
This is the data challenge project - Sport Analysis in UoE Design Informatics.

## Project Objective
We aim to explore factors of team success in professional football domain, in terms of combinations of players including their career paths, diversity of ages, nationalities and so on.

## Structure Description
- Data_Process - Source codes to process the data.
- Data_Selected - Data selected for the visualization.

## How to Run Programs in Data_Process?
Since Github limits the size of every single file uploaded to be smaller than 100MB, I was not able to upload our datasets here. Therefore, currently if you want to run programs in Data_Process, you need to put our datasets into a folder named 'sport_datasets', and put the folder into the same dictionary of this project (your local dictionary). Then the data can be loaded successfully.

If you are adding new programs that process the datasets, please also set file paths as '../../sport_datasets/FileName'.
