## Explaining Structural Folding

Structural fold: the overlap of groups that have differing previous experience within a team. For example, if two football teams merge to create one, there may be some players who have represented both teams, creating an overlap in experience – these players would represent the structural fold. The 'Game Changer' paper argues that to generate creative success, there should be a variety of past experiences within a team, otherwise a reduction of innovation will lead to conformity. However, this variety of experience stresses the importance of the structural fold – to channel communication and create common understanding, attributing to success.
